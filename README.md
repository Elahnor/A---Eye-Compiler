Pronounced as "AI," it combines "Auto" and "Eye" to form "Automata," reflecting the project's focus. Inspired by the Anime Series "One Piece," A-Eye uses reserved words like 'onboard' and 'offboard' for 'start' and 'end.' The compiler offers features such as Input, Output, Conditional statements, Looping, Logical and Mathematical Operators, and Control structures. 

A-Eye provides a unique coding experience that merges efficiency with functionality, allowing programmers to navigate the seas of programming with creativity.
